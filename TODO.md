# Things to do.

## Technical Implementation

- [x] `kiota` is not a good fit for the project
- [x] review `openapi-codegen` and `openapi-generator` for Pydantic model generation
	- `openapi-codegen` is a good fit for the project (supports pydantic, etc.)
- [ ] look for more lessons learned with `kiota`
	- [ ] httx abstraction (can be added later)

## Endpoints

- [ ] add support for roles, endpoints, compute, etc. 
- [ ] saved queries? proceed without for now. 

## General

- [ ] review naming conventions
- [ ] add tests
- [ ] add ci/cd
- [ ] add documentation
