# Things to do.

## Technical Implementation

- [x] review `openapi-codegen` and `openapi-generator` for Pydantic model generation  [completion:: 2024-01-18]
	- `openapi-codegen` is a good fit for the project (supports pydantic, etc.)
- [ ] look for more lessons learned with `kiota`
	- [ ] httx abstraction (can be added later)
	- [x] request adapters (overkill)  [completion:: 2024-01-18]
	- [ ] 

## Endpoints
- [ ] continue refactoring names of models in schema.py to remove `Model1` pattern.
- [ ] add support for roles, endpoints, compute, etc. 
- [ ] saved queries? proceed without for now. 

## General

- [ ] review naming conventions
- [ ] add tests
- [ ] add ci/cd
